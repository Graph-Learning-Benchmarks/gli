    abstract = {Freebase is a practical, scalable tuple database used to structure general human knowledge. The data in Freebase is collaboratively created, structured, and maintained. Freebase currently contains more than 125,000,000 tuples, more than 4000 types, and more than 7000 properties. Public read/write access to Freebase is allowed through an HTTP-based graph-query API using the Metaweb Query Language (MQL) as a data query and manipulation language. MQL provides an easy-to-use object-oriented interface to the tuple data in Freebase and is designed to facilitate the creation of collaborative, Web-based data-oriented applications.},

## Preprocessing

The data files and task config file in GLB format are transformed from the [OpenKE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE) implementation.

### Requirements

The preprocessing code requires the following packages.

```
scipy==1.7.1
```
