# OGBG-MOLHIV

## Dataset Description
The ogbg-molhiv contains molecule graphs adopted from the MoleculeNet. The molecule graphs are converted from SMIE strings using RDKit. Each graph represents a molecule, where nodes are atoms, and edges are chemical bonds. Input node features are 9-dimensional, containing atomic number and chirality, as well as other additional atom features such as formal charge and whether the atom is in the ring or not.


Statistics:
- Graph: 41,127
- Nodes per graph: 25.5
- Edges per graph: 27.5
