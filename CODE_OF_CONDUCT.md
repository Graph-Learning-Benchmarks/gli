# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

The Graph Learning Indexer (GLI) is a collaborative project that aims to 
include contributors from the broader graph learning community with a wide 
range of identities and backgrounds. The diversity of participants will be an 
important asset to the project for its goal towards developing and curating a 
representative set of graph learning benchmarks that reflect the diverse 
real-world applications well. Consequently, GLI adheres to this Code of Conduct
based on the 
[Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) 
and [Geoblacklight Code of Conduct](https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
as guiding principles for our work together.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers of the GLI project pledge to make 
participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex 
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, 
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or 
sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project team at GraphLearningBenchmarks@gmail.com.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team
is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.

## Code of Ethics on Dataset Contribution

We ask the dataset contributors to adhere to a high ethics standard for dataset contribution, especially for data collection. Project maintainers may deprecate datasets on ethical grounds. 

### Data Collection

Examples of ethical considerations to keep in mind include (but not limited to):

* Conduct an ethical review process (e.g., by an Institutional Review Board) when human subjects are involved.
* * When the data involves sensitive information about human subjects, ensure the data does not involve [Personally Identifiable Information (PII)](https://www.dhs.gov/privacy-training/what-personally-identifiable-information).
* Think about how the data collection process may inject (potentially harmful) biases into the dataset.
* Avoid toxic content unless the dataset is purposed for goals such as content detoxification, in which cases an explicit warning should be marked in the documentation of the dataset.
* Consider what are the potential unethical exploitation of the collected data.

We refer the dataset contributors to the following resources for more ethical considerations in data collection.

- [Gebru, Timnit, et al. "Datasheets for datasets." Communications of the ACM 64.12 (2021): 86-92.](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2021/12/256932-datasheets-for-datasets/fulltext)
- [Cote, Catherine. 5 PRINCIPLES OF DATA ETHICS FOR BUSINESS. Harvard Business School Online's Business Insights Blog (2021).](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/data-ethics)

### Dataset Deprecation

Ethical concerns regarding the datasets hosted in the GLI repository can be raised as issues on GitHub or sent to the project team at GraphLearningBenchmarks@gmail.com. Project maintainers will review and investigate the reported concerns and will deprecate any dataset with ethical issues. An ethical note explaining the specific issues will be first incorporated into the metadata of the deprecated dataset, and then the dataset will be removed from the main branch to discourage further use of the dataset. The deprecation of the [Boston Housing dataset in Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html) is an example of this process.
