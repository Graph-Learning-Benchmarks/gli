# twitch-gamers

## Dataset Description
Twitch-gamers is a connected undirected graph of relationships between accounts on the streaming platform Twitch. Each node is a Twitch account, and edges exist between accounts that are mutual followers. The node features include number of views, creation and update dates, language, life time, and whether the account is dead. The binary classification task is to predict whether the channel has explicit content.

Statistics:
- Nodes: 168114
- Edges: 6797557
- Number of Classes: 2

## Preprocessing
The data file in GLB format is transformed from the [CUAI](https://github.com/CUAI/Non-Homophily-Large-Scale). Check [Non-homo-datasets](https://github.com/GreatSnoopyMe/Non-homo-datasets) for the preprocessing.


### Requirements

The preprocessing code requires the following packages.

```
dataset==1.5.2
numpy==1.22.3
