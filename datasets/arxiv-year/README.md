# arXiv-year

## Dataset Description
arXiv-year is the ogbn-arXiv network with different labels. This dataset was originally created by Wang<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup> and transformed by Hu<sup>[2](#myfootnote2)</sup> as well as Lim<sup>[3](#myfootnote3)</sup>. The difference between this dataset and ogbn-arXiv is that the class labels are set to be the year that the paper is posted, instead of paper subject area.  The nodes are arXiv papers, and directed edges connect a paper to other papers that it cites. The node features are averaged word2vec token features of both the title and abstract of the paper. The five classes are chosen by partitioning the posting dates so that class ratios are approximately balanced.

Statistics:
- Nodes: 169343
- Edges: 1166243
- Number of Classes: 5

## Preprocessing
The data file in GLI format is transformed from the [CUAI](https://github.com/CUAI/Non-Homophily-Large-Scale). Check [Non-homo-datasets](https://github.com/GreatSnoopyMe/Non-homo-datasets) for the preprocessing.


### Requirements

The preprocessing code requires the following packages.

```
dataset==1.5.2
numpy==1.22.3
scipy==1.7.3
torch==1.11.0
```
