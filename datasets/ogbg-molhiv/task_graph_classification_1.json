    "description": "The task is to predict the target molecular properties as accurately as possible, where the molecular properties are cast as binary labels, e.g, whether a molecule inhibits HIV virus replication or not. Note that some datasets (e.g., ogbg-molpcba) can have multiple tasks, and can contain nan that indicates the corresponding label is not assigned to the molecule.",
