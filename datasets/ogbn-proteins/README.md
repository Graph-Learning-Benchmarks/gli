# Ogbn-proteins
## Data Description

The **ogbn-proteins** dataset is an undirected, weighted, and typed (according to species) graph. Nodes represent proteins, and edges indicate different types of biologically meaningful associations between proteins, e.g., physical interactions, co-expression or homology. All edges come with 8-dimensional features, where each dimension represents the approximate confidence of a single association type and takes values between 0 and 1 (the larger the value is, the more confident we are about the association). The proteins come from 8 species.

Statistics:
1. Nodes: 132534
2. Edges: 79122504
