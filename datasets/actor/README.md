# Actor

## Dataset Description
This dataset is the actor-only induced subgraph of the film-director-actor-writer network (Tang et al., 2009). Each nodes correspond to an actor, and the edge between two nodes denotes co-occurrence on the same Wikipedia page. Node features correspond to some keywords in the Wikipedia pages. We classify the nodes into five categories in term of words of actorâ€™s Wikipedia.


Statistics:
- Nodes: 7600
- Edges: 30019
- Number of Classes: 5

## Preprocessing
The data files and task config file in GLB format are transformed from the [torch_geometric.datasets](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/datasets.html). Check `actor.ipynb` for the preprocessing.


### Requirements

The preprocessing code requires the following packages.

```
numpy==1.22.3
scipy==1.7.3
torch==1.11.0
torch_geometric==2.0.4
```
