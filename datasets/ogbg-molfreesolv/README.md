# Ogbg-molfreesolv
## Data Description

*Ogbg-molfreesolv* contains molecule graphs adopted from the MoleculeNet. The molecule graphs are converted from SMIE strings using RDKit. Each graph represents a molecule, where nodes are atoms, and edges are chemical bonds. Input node features are 9-dimensional, containing atomic number and chirality, as well as other additional atom features such as formal charge and whether the atom is in the ring or not.

Statistics:
- Nodes: 5600
- Edges: 642
