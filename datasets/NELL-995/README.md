# NELL-995

## Dataset Description

The NELL-995 dataset is a subset of the NELL dataset which captures two types of knowledge: (1) knowledge about which noun phrases refer to which specified semantic categories, such as cities, companies, and sports teams, and (2) knowledge about which pairs of noun phrases satisfy which specified semantic relations, such as hasOfficesIn(organization, location). It has a total of 154,213 triplets with 75,492 entities and 200 unique relationships.

Statistics:
- Nodes: 75492
- Edges: 154213

## Preprocessing

The data files and task config file in GLB format are transformed from the [OpenKE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenKE) implementation.

### Requirements

The preprocessing code requires the following packages.

```
scipy==1.7.1
```
