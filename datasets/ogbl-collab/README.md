# OGBL-COLLAB

## Dataset Description
The ogbl-collab dataset is an undirected graph, representing a subset of the collaboration network between authors indexed by MAG[1]. Each node represents an author and edges indicate the collaboration between authors. All nodes come with 128-dimensional features, obtained by averaging the word embeddings of papers that are published by the authors. All edges are associated with two meta-information: the year and the edge weight, representing the number of co-authored papers published in that year. The graph can be viewed as a dynamic multi-graph since there can be multiple edges between two nodes if they collaborate in more than one year.
